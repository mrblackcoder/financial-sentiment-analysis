"""
Traditional Machine Learning Models

This module contains implementations for traditional ML classifiers:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest

These models are used via sklearn directly in train_and_evaluate.py
for the Financial Sentiment Analysis project.
"""

# Models are instantiated directly from sklearn in the main scripts
# This module serves as a placeholder for potential future custom implementations
